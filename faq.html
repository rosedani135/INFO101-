<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<p>Is everything sustainabily sourced?</p>
		<p>Yes! We source all of our materials from 100% recylced materials. 
		Our supply chains are all fair trade certifide and pay Livingwages 
		to all staff members.
		</p>
	<p>Do you have any discount codes or sales?</p>
	<p>Unfortunately we do not have any discount codes to offer. We only have one 
		sale per year and only have limited stock to avoid over consumption and 
		we can keep our costs at a minimum.

<p>Why 'The Supportive Clothing'</p>
<p>Our brand name is inspired by our passion of supporting the environment through
